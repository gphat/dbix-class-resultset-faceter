=head1 NAME

DBIx::Class::ResultSet::Faceter - Faceting for DBIx::Class ResultSets

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $faceter = DBIx::Class::ResultSet::Faceter->new;

  # Add a Column facet for the name_last column
  $faceter->add_facet('Column', {
	name => 'Last Name', column => 'name_last'
  });
  # Add more, if you like
  $faceter->add_facet('CodeRef', {
    name => 'Avg Test Score', code => sub { # something fancy }
  });

  # Even for HashRefInflator stuff
  $faceter->add_facet('HashRef', {
    name => 'DoB', key => 'date_of_birth'
  });

  # Pass in a resultset and get a results object
  my $results = $faceter->facet($resultset);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Faceter is a mechanism for "faceting" a resultset, or counting the occurrences
of certain data.  Faceting is a common search pattern, represented by
the sidebars that tell how how many of your search results fall in a certain
price range or are members of a certain category.

This module allows you to perform these types of operations on the results
of a database query via a L<DBIx::Class::ResultSet>.

=head2 What about GROUP BY?

Using an SQL C<GROUP BY> can do the same things that this module does.  The
reason I've created this module is to allow for more complex situations and
to avoid generating more SQL queries.  Large facet implementations that cover
dozens of dimensions can quickly cause an SQL query to become unweildy.  This
module provides an alternate approach for people who may've run afoul of the
aforementioned problems.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 facets

List of facets, keyed by name.

Add a facet to this faceter.

        # it like a fully qualified class name.

            # Instantiate the damned thing with the leftover arguments, but do
            # it in this try so if it blows up we can report the failure.
            $facet = $class->new($args);
        } catch {
            die "Tried to load the class '$class' as a Facet and failed: $_";

=head2 facet

Performs the faceting, returning a L<DBIx::Class::Faceter::Result> object.

            # retval in the result!
